# crystal-imgui

#### [Crystal][] bindings to [Dear ImGui][imgui], through [cimgui][]

Introduction
------------

This library lets you use [Dear ImGui][imgui] with the [Crystal][] programming language.

[Dear ImGui][imgui] is an immediate-mode library for programming and rendering graphical user interfaces. But note that just by itself it won't directly let you do those things, it needs to be wired up to code that actually handles rendering and input. You can write these yourself or use a library ("backend"):

* [crystal-imgui-sfml][] - backend using [SFML][] (assumed through [CrSFML][]).  
  Please refer to its instructions primarily, as it takes over large parts of the installation.

Installation
------------

Following the installation process of [crystal-imgui-sfml][] is recommended instead (it even provides *libcimgui.so* automatically), but continue here if you want an alternate route.

*crystal-imgui* actually binds to the [cimgui][] library. The supported version is bundled as a submodule (for other versions you can try your luck by [re-generating sources](#contributing)). This repository needs to have been cloned with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/oprypin/crystal-imgui
```

Then you can build [cimgui][]:

```bash
cd cimgui
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-DIMGUI_USE_WCHAR32' .
cmake --build .
ln -s cimgui.so libcimgui.so  # or .dylib on macOS
```

Yes, the flag is required (just makes the library play much nicely with Unicode *and* Crystal), and the symlink is also required, because the library ends up as _cimgui.so_ but somehow is referred by both that name and _libcimgui.so_.

### Building a project

Try the example from inside the folder of *crystal-imgui*:

```bash
crystal run examples/test.cr
```

Prior to that you'll need to add *cimgui* to the library search path:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/cimgui"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/cimgui"
```

For your own project, *crystal-imgui* will be in a subdirectory, so adjust this accordingly.

Usage
-----

Examples of most possible usages of the library are covered in the extensive [src/demo.cr](src/demo.cr) (entry point [examples/demo.cr](examples/demo.cr)).

Using *crystal-imgui* is agnostic of the [backend](#introduction) for the most part, you invoke those just at the beginning of a frame, to process inputs, and at the end, to do the actual rendering (generally [imgui][] just builds up the things to be drawn until the end).

The API surface follows [Dear ImGui][imgui] itself very closely. Main differences are:

* Functions are lowercased: `ImGui::InputFloat3()` becomes `ImGui.input_float3`.
* Types are all in the module as well: `ImGuiIO` becomes `ImGui::ImGuiIO`.
    * *But* you're welcome to "unpack" those as an opt-in, by running `include ImGui::TopLevel`.
* Enums are namespaced.
* **Important**: To faithfully preserve the APIs of ImGui where its functions accept pointers that are used both for input and output (and for lack of an obvious alternative), *crystal-imgui* also requires pointers to be passed to it in the same way.
    * **However**, since Crystal requires very prohibitive circumstances to be able to take an actual pointer, *crystal-imgui* actually wraps these functions into macros, for which `pointerof(foo.bar)` is just a fake syntax that will be transformed into a call to `foo.bar` for reading and a call to `foo.bar=(value)` for writing. As another example, `pointerof(arr[0])` also works - rewritten as `arr[0] = value`.
* String buffers (particularly begin+end pairs) are abstracted as IO::Memory (imgui's own text buffer is discouraged).
    * *crystal-imgui* even takes the liberty to implement the buffer resize callback for unbounded text inputs.
* `ImVector` is discouraged. Usually you can just work with `Array` or `Slice`.
* `ImColor` is even more discouraged, in favor of `ImVec4`. See some color helper functions in _src/imgui.cr_.

### Known issues

(planned to be fixed)

* Variadic arguments to printf-like functions seem to be broken.
* Getters and setters of structs are very iffy.
    * In many cases they should be nilable but aren't.
* Likely undiscovered bugs

Contributing
------------

Note that most source files of *crystal-imgui* are auto-generated from outputs of [cimgui][].

If you're editing files, make sure they wouldn't be overwritten by `generate.cr` - in that case that is the file that you should be editing instead. In general, to generate the source code, run this:

```bash
crystal generate.cr  # assumes cimgui/ is populated, writes to src/
crystal tool format src
```
